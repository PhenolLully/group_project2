## Concept

```md
Five movies are generated based on user-inputted 
search criteria at the click of a button. 
Movies are pulled from the API that the owner created through Sequelized 
and displayed below the application.

## User Story

```md
AS someone who watches movies a lot and likes to find good movies every now and then,
I WANT to choose from five diffent genres of movies and generate five differnt movies related to that genre at the click of a button,
SO that I can enjoy a movie whenever I want to watch one,
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```md
When a user inserts there log in information,
They are presented with 5 categories.
Each button generates five movies based on their respective categories (Action, Thriller, Horror, Comedy & Romance movies)
When a user presses one of the five genre button,
Five movies will be pulled from the movie API databases, and generated under
the buttons.
The users login information will be(saved to the local storage)
```


## Direction of Future Development

```md
Our next feature will be adding a save button for each movie generated.
To increase usability, we aim to add more movies to a database
From this, we can widen the scope of our target audience.
This application is meant to be an easy to find any movie that an individual likes, 
and when users are looking to raise their spirits with a good or great movie.
 We will work to increase our application to that can be accessed across 
most devices with a smooth and polished user interface.
